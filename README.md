# Battle Client
An open source example usage of [Pebsie's APIBattle project](https://github.com/Pebsie/APIBattle/blob/master/README.md) developed in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2019.

## How to run the game
Download [Love2D](https://love2d.org). If you want to use the portable version then drag the battleClient folder onto the `love` executable. If you installed Love2D then create a zip (main.lua needs to be in the base folder!) and rename it to game.love, then double click to open.
